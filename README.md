# Cryptocurrencies

### Technology Used

This project was analyzed in Jupyter notebooks with using Python with Pandas, plotly, sklearn and hvplot.  Then, I used get_dummies to create variables for the text features and scaled the data using StandardScaler and fit_transform.  The data was then used to find the Elbow Curve to determine the best k value and was graphed using matplotlib to then perform the unsupervised machine learning.

### Project Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to determine an easier way to interpret the trade value of cryptocurrencies for Accountability Accounting.  The data received was not the easiest to understand; however, through unsupervised machine learning the data was placed in graphs for easier understanding.  Overall, the graph below is based on the supply of coins vs the coins mined after putting them in the classes.  The best class to invest in would be class 2 due to having a higher supply and ability to mine.  Below is a graph that demonstrates this data.
